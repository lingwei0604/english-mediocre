All About,Lesson 2 - Learn The English Writing System.

Hey everyone and welcome back,I'm Chihiro and welcome to EnglishClass101.com.This is All About English Lesson 2. Daniel and I are going to explain a little bit more about the writing system in English.

Right, we're going to briefly talk about who english is written with a pencil and paper... or printed.

Listeners, you must likely know the alphabet, the 26 letter writing system that consists of 21 consonants and 5 vowels either from you own language, or from studying it. It has no diacritics,which are marking on letters to show can be written in two ways, upper case and lower case.

You probably have seen the alphabet around you, perhaps on products or on TV, even if English is not an official or even a second language for that matter in our country.

Some languages that use alphabet have a phonemic system...which...

A what system?

A phonemic system, which means that the sound corresponds to the letter of the alphabet, it mean you can probably spell the word just by hearing it.

Right.

The spelling for english is to a certain extent phonemic,but the ruels are more complex that other phonemic languages,This means that are spelling is not always easy to figure out just from hearing the wrold.
this is because it has influences from French,Greek,Latin,and other languages.

Also, between 1400 - 1700 there was a major change in the pronunciation of vowels, This is called the Great Vowel Shift.

Which also accounts for irregularities in the writing system. there are several theories behind this ,but immigration could be one, the need to coommunicate with people with different accents meant adjusting pronunciation.
