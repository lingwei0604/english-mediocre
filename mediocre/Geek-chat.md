i just thought of a hack
Tegegram hack, the api normally requires a phone for verification.

If you have someones key/hash pair, you can send that phone verification to any number through api?

IDK, it seemss that way?

Anyway, if anyone is trying touse that, make sure to put in your corrent phone so the verification actually works and it doesnt sent the code?

i just got into bitcoins.
i was shouting bitcions since 2010 and i myself didno't do anything,my friends did all of it.

now am lagging behind.

The souce is not open at all, its jut on github.
its been complied,but they donnot release source bro.
