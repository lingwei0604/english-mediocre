I just finished my website, and when i visit the site with a desktop brower,it books nice,But when i visit the site with a mobible device,the site is illegible.

the above link doesn't  send any content-length yet thiss python code is showing 23!

well, you almost never need to explicitly cast to an integer..
python does it implicitly.

and something bigger than maxint isn't going to fit in an integer, they have depricted integer in python3, now only long exists.

is this your first time looking at python?

why are you casting to integer in the first place?
as it says, 4.6M is an invalid number to pass to an integer.

since this is a 3.4k member group which makes it different to follow every discussion, Most of us mute the group and sometimes miss something important(either for us or for others)

there should be something(.bot) so that people can subscribe to #hashtags# or keywords/phrases in the messages of the group same as we have favourite tags in Stackoverflow.

so whenever a message with my subscribed hastags/keywords is posted in the group,then the bot should forward that message to me.

this will help me the group(s) being more productive.
