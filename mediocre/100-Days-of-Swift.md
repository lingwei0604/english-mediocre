Since Apple announced Swift as the new modern language for their products,I've been wanting to learn it, Even though my background isn't programing,I decided to give it a shot,A little more than a month ago, I finished my 100 Days of Swift Project.

checkout all my Swift projects:

How much programming expericence did you have before learing Swift?

Short answer: Not a lot.
Long answer: My background is Motion Graphics and I'm a self-taught Web Developer, I know HTML,CSS,Sass,JavsScript,jQuery, some Reby and Python,but haven't built an app before, Although I'm well versed in HTML and CSS, a programmer friend conviced me that those languages are scripting languages,They are used to describe and style content,Programming languages, I have to say it helped me get used to looking at code and debugging errors.

Was Swift easy to learn?

Yes , Swift syntax was easy to learn, Apple did an incredible good job designing the languge and launching a detailed book at the  same time,but Swift is only 1 piece of the puzzel - before i could build my first app,I had to learn:

1:Swift 
2:Xcode
3:Programming Concepts
4:iOS Frameworks


what are some good resources to learn Swift?
I studied and read everything I could find on Swift, I also read plenty of material on programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming and MVC Architecture.I think it's more important to learn programming than it is to learn Swift syntax, I'll speak about that in the next section,In no particular order,here are some good places to start learning Swift:


You mentioned that learning programming is more important than learning Swift syntax?

Yse because leanring programming lets you start building things.

I spent plenty of time trying to build things and asking questions-- wondering how things workded , I wouldn't say i learned programming because i'm still learing, But I remember the moment when it clicked in my head, when I finally had an understanding of how things worked,
This actually has nothing to do with Swift, but the moment programming cliked in my head was when i used a protoyping tool called Framer, it's built on the idea of immediate interactive code visualization ,an idea Bret Virtor introduces in his talk "Inventing on princple ", Using Framer gave me a gerneal understanding of code structure,It gave me anawers to questions like :
