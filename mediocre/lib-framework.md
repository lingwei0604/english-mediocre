whats the difference between library and framework according to you not google?

to me a library is like ingredients that have already been prepared,i.e bread or cheese so it's something you don't have to make yourself,A framework is like a skeleton to me you apply the details but basic work is there already.

the lib, have a group of functions that works for a one purpos  at most but in a different ways, its provie u much help like gieing u an additional features u could add it to u app and without spending time to write it,for ex: u have an app and added sql lib,this lib will gather the data to u in xml or json for example,but it's amis to  amke  the conncetions and give u the data in the most secur and simple way.

the lib is at most will be a group of sperated function for mroe taht one activity but to work for the same purpos.

framework is a group of libs, are connected and structed to make u just add ur details.

looks ao beautiful.
